"""Utility wrappers around ``team_select_optimized_lib`` for PyQt GUI.

This module re-exports core functions and constants from
``team_select_optimized_lib`` so that the PyQt GUI does not import the
original module directly. Any adjustments needed for the GUI can be
implemented here without modifying the original library.

The packaged executable built with PyInstaller runs from a temporary
directory, so relying on ``__file__`` to locate ``players.csv`` fails. We
need to resolve the CSV path differently when frozen into an executable
to keep the GUI working after compilation.
